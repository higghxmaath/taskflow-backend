Why This Project Matters

This project was intentionally built while learning to solve a common failure point in full-stack development: “The frontend and backend worked separately, but crashed when connected.”

To prevent that, TaskFlow was built to expriement knowledge aquired using:

API Contract First

Backend validated with Postman

Deployed backend before frontend integration

Environment-based configuration

Modern tooling (Vite, Tailwind, Render, Vercel)
